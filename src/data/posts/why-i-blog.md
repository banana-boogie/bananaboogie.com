The question to answer in this post is why am I writing a blog. Be honest. Tell your truth. Do it for yourself.

Writing a blog will help me with my communication skills. One of the skills I believe will give me a competitive advantage in life. I want to improve the skill of expressing myself.

The blog is a foundational platform for me to build on top off. It gives me the space to express and share my ideas.

I don’t 100% want to do it, which makes it more appealing to me. I know that this is part of my path. Ignoring it won’t help me in the long run. I find that when I want something in life, there is always a path to take. The tasks return over and over again. It’s not until I walk down the path, act and do what I hear in my mind to do that I’m able to move forward. So this is my walking down the path, to uncover more about who I am and where I am to go.

I’m writing this blog to grow. It’s for myself to show who I am. To push past more of my insecurities. To learn more about the world, different topics and who I am. By pushing myself to keep writing, I will learn and uncover more. By doing things that I don’t want to do, I grow.

I’m writing this blog to share what I learn, to get feedback, to receive criticism.

I’m writing this blog to teach. I remember once upon a time, I loved to teach. It filled me with joy, a sense of purpose.

I’m writing this blog to show who I am. I’m writing this blog to be brave, to show who I am in public.

I’m writing this blog for my kids, by writing I force myself to become the father I know in my heart I can be. That man isn’t afraid to show who he is. That man shares his worldview. That man pushes past discomfort.

I’m writing this blog for myself, that I shouldn’t forget. There are other reasons for writing, but, here I am to remind myself to keep true to myself.

I’m writing this blog to build a personal brand. It’s a way of documenting the things I’ve done, and showcasing my skills.

I’m writing this blog to help me with my career, to make money and to uncover another purpose for work. I believe that it will help me on my journey of increasing my income. Perhaps it provides me an income directly, but if not directly it will indirectly by helping my improve my skills of communication.

In summary, I’m writing this blog for myself, my skills, my future, my self esteem, my confidence, my career, my money, my personal brand.
